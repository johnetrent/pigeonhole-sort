# Pigeonhole sort

From [wikipedia]:

> Pigeonhole sorting is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting lists
> of elements where the number of elements (n) and the length of the range of
> possible key values (N) are approximately the same. It requires O(n + N)
> time. It is similar to counting sort, but differs in that it "moves items
> twice: once to the bucket array and again to the final destination [whereas]
> counting sort builds an auxiliary array then uses the array to compute each
> item's final destination and move the item there."
> The pigeonhole algorithm works as follows:
> 1. Given an array of values to be sorted, set up an auxiliary array of
> initially empty "pigeonholes," one pigeonhole for each key through the range
> of the original array.
> 2. Going over the original array, put each value into the pigeonhole
> corresponding to its key, such that each pigeonhole eventually contains a
> list of all values with that key.
> 3. Iterate over the pigeonhole array in order, and put elements from non-empty
> pigeonholes back into the > original array.
